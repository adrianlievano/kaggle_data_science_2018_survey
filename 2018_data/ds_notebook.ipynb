    "# 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey #\n",
    "### A Comprehensive Survey Analysis of 24,000 Machine Learning & Data Science Practioners####\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, as last year, we set out to conduct an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey was live for one week in October, and after cleaning the data we finished with 23,859 responses, a 49% increase over last year!\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot to explore here. The results include raw numbers about who is working with data, what’s happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists to break into the field. We've published the data in as raw a format as possible without compromising anonymization, which makes it an unusual example of a survey dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge objective: tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration. A “story” could be defined any number of ways, and that’s deliberate. The challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners. That group can be defined in the macro (for example: anyone who does most of their coding in Python) or the micro (for example: female data science students studying machine learning in masters programs). This is an opportunity to be creative and tell the story of a community you identify with or are passionate about!\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions will be evaluated on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition - Is there a clear narrative thread to the story that’s articulated and supported by data? The subject should be well defined, well researched, and well supported through the use of data and visualizations.\n",
    "Originality - Does the reader learn something new through this submission? Or is the reader challenged to think about something in a new way? A great entry will be informative, thought provoking, and fresh all at the same time.\n",
    "Documentation - Are your code, and kernel, and additional data sources well documented so a reader can understand what you did? Are your sources clearly cited? A high quality analysis should be concise and clear at each step so the rationale is easy to follow and the process is reproducible"
